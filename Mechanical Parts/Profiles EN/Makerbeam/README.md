# Makerbeam Profiles

This part of the library are the Makerbeam profiles and accessories (brackets, corner cubes).

## Usage

Just use as any other library part:
_Macro_->_Macros_->_PartsLibrary.FCMacro_

These parts are located under "Mechanical Parts"-"Profiles EN"-"Makerbeam"

__Note:__ If you import multiple instances of the makerbeam\_profile.FCStd, the FIRST _Parameter\_MakerBeam_ Spreadsheet for setting up the length
is used for all profiles! So I recommend to use the STEP files, which have the length values originally sold by Makerbeam.
